MongoDB is used for storing the data and MonoEngine is used which acts as an Object Document Mapper with MongoDB. This system uses a REST API to add the data into the mogoDBatlas and local mongoDBcompass. User will add the details using POST operation.


The Flask microweb framework provides libraries to build lightweight web applications in
python. This gives us a simple and reliable way to create the project. Flask supports
extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself.
Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various
open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools. The
experience of developing the group component in the system also helped me learning a lot
of website development with Flask. By using flask microweb extensions, we have
successfully accomplished the requirements of the system. Once the user logged in to the
system, user can book the cake from the cake caferetia and an rest API used to add the
data .
